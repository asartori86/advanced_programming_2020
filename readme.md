# Advanced Programming [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/asartori86/advanced_programming_2020.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asartori86/advanced_programming_2020)

[SISSA webpage](http://www.math.sissa.it/course/phd-course-master-course/advanced-programming-2)

The course aims to provide advanced knowledge of both theoretical and practical programming in C++14 and Python3, with particular regard to the principles of object-oriented programming and best practices of software development.

Syllabus:

- Introduction to C++11. You will learn the logic and the basics of C++11, the built-in data types and how to effectively use them. Best practices in programming will be addressed.
- Object orientation in C++11. The principles of Object-Oriented programming will be presented with particular attention to their implementations in C++11. Some of the most important Design Patterns will be discussed.
- Advanced features of C++14/17. Some of the new features of standard C++/14/17 will be introduced and explained.
- Python3. After a recap of the basics of Python3, you will learn how to program in object-oriented fashion in the Python3 programming language.
- How to combine the two languages. Several methods to combine the two languages will be presented.


## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with linux terminal and a text editor (e.g., emacs, vim)

  - merge the branches in your local master
  - push on the master of your fork
- if(conflict)
  - if(rebase)
    - `git add`
    - `git rebase --continue`
    - if(bigger mess)
      	- `git rebase --abort`
